# Global Weather

After analyzing the trends in weather data there are several strong correlations and trends that became noticeable. One of the strongest correlations was between City Latitude and Max temperature in the northern hemisphere. The correlation value was -0.9. As latitude increased, temperature decreased. This is most likely explained by cities being further away from the equator. There was a similar correlation between City Latitude and Max temperature in the southern hemisphere. The correlation value was 0.65. As city latitude increased, temperature also tended to increase. The correlation might not have been as strong as in the northern hemisphere because the southern hemisphere is generally warmer. Certain data revealed that there was little no correlation between factors. For example, there was a non-significant correlation of 0.16, between city latitude and humidity percentage in the southern hemisphere. Humidity tended to as latitude increased. This is most likely explained by being closer to the equator.
